Timer1

Your timer is basically a counter that regulates the speed at which 1's and 0's appear on your output. It has many features and
is in a 16 bit register. 

Registers are like little containers or boxes in which you put 1's or 0's. Whether you put a 1 or 0 in any specific container,
or register, it will change the way your timer operates. The document on Timers, which is quite long, is located here:

At some point, the more you know about these things the better, but for starting, just stick to the basics and work your way up.

When using the timer in your code, it's a good idea to clear it: 

TMR1 = 0;

To configure the timer, we find the name and meaning of the registers and use the functions we want.

15  14  13  12    11  10  9   8    7  6    5   4    3   2   1  0     <--- Bit Location in cells
[1] [0] [0] [0]  [0] [0] [0] [0]  [0] [0] [1] [1]  [0] [0] [0] [0]   <--- Register cells

1000 hex=     0000 hex=     0011 hex=     0000 hex=
     8           0             3             0

Some people are a little confused converting binary into hex, and the grouping is a little strange. They are all grouped in 4's

[1] [1] [1] [1] in Hex is F 
   
[0] [0] [0] [0] in Hex is 0


 8   4   2   1
[1] [1] [1] [1]  is F because hex works like this:


0 = 0
1 = 1
2 = 2
3 = 3
4 = 4
5 = 5
6 = 6
7 = 7
8 = 8
9 = 9
A = 10
B = 11
C = 12
D = 13
E = 14
F = 15
 
Treat the group of 4 as binary. Add them together and you have a totoal of 15. Go to the Hexidecimal chart, and 15 = F. If it's
your first time seeing Binary, take about an hour and google "how convert binary to decimal". And if you need more Hex examples,
google "How to convert binary to Hexidecimal".


The only functions we are using in the timer are Bit 15, (T)ON,  TCKPS (bit 4 and 5), and that's it. Putting that into hex
form yields 0x8030. Whereas 0x denotes Hex notation.

So to manipulate or set these settings in the Timer, notice we do not write TMR1=0x8030! Instead, we use the T1CON register for
this (details in the document referenced above)

T1CON = 0x8030

We have 3 signals that control Timer1. TMR1 has a 16 bit counter value, T1CON controls activation and operating mode, and PR1
produces a periodic timer reset.
