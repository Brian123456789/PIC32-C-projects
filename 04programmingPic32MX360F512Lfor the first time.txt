Programming The PIC32MX360F512L Using Explorer 

16/32

Note: Your first time running, before things are 

set up, your programming icon will be greyed out. 

To get things ready for programming, do the 

following:

1. Plug in a usb cable to J18.
2. Right click on your project and make sure it is 

set as "main project"
3. Go to file, project properties. Set Family as 

PIC32 bit MCU's. In the MCU device window, put your 

part number here, in this case PIC32MX360F512L.
4. In the "Hardware tools" list, select PICKit3, or 

IC3 programmer (depending on which you bought) 

click apply, click ok. Note: You MUST buy a 

programmer to use with the PIC32MX chip. PKOB does 

not work with this chip. If you use PICKit3 you 

won't be able to see your PORTA LED's light up 

because it shares them as input ports. Only Use 

PIKKit3 if you want to use boundry scanning. 

PikKit2 does not work with this chip. Anything that 

is not green in the selection window does not work 

with Explorer16/32.
5. Click "Build main Project" icon (a hammer)
6.Click "Make and program device main project" (an 

arrow into a chip icon)
